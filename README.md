# bd-sorting-algorithms-solution

This repository is a solution to the Code-Along for BD 7.2. You are encouraged to explore and write your own implementation for a couple of sorting algorithms as this is a common request during a whiteboard portion of a technical interview. SelectionSort, InsertionSort are the easiest, and BubbleSort is often requested specifically.
