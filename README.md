# 7.1 Sorting Algorithms

Sorting algorithms are a staple of computer programming and an excellent way to understand computational complexity and Big O notation.

## Project Overview

This project has several classes which implement the SortingAlgorithm interface and have their own implementation of a sort method. The SortingApplication class creates unsorted lists of random integers and passes them to each of the algorithms to sort. The time it takes is recorded for each algorithm for each dataset and the results will help you to analyze the time complexity as the size of the dataset grows large.

You are encouraged to explore and play with this project. Even try writing your own implementation for a couple of sorting algorithms as this is a common request during a whiteboard portion of a technical interview. 
SelectionSort and InsertionSort are the easiest, and BubbleSort is often requested specifically.
